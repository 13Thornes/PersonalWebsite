        <p class="aboutMePara">My name is Samantha Thorne, and I live in Corner Brook Newfoundland and Labrador. Since I'm a recent graduate of Keyin College's Software Development program, I wanted to create this website to show off some of the skills I've learned so far and start a portfolio.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="aboutMePara">I chose a silly word generator as my first project to display my ability to work with JavaScript, node.js, express, and a PostgreSQL database. It also serves as a way to have a little laugh today, and maybe learn a new word or two! The database has a total of 50 silly words so far, so there's plenty to learn.</p>
